                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p> Celeste is an acclaimed platform game developed by Matt Makes Games, released in 2018.
                    story follows Madeline, a young woman with a tireless determination to climb the mountain
                    Celeste, on a journey that challenges both her physical strength and her emotional resilience. THE
                    mountain, which is as challenging as it is symbolic, represents the internal and external obstacles that
                    Madeline faces, and throughout the journey, players are led through a narrative
                    deeply personal and moving. With hand-drawn pixelated graphics and a soundtrack
                    environment composed by Lena Raine, Celeste offers a charming aesthetic and a rich ambience,
                    that reinforce the emotional intensity of the experience. </p>

                <h2>Narrative</h2>
                <p> Celeste's narrative is delivered delicately, addressing themes such as anxiety and
                    self-discovery,
                    without resorting to explicit explanations, allowing players to explore Madeline's psychology
                    through dialogues and introspective moments. During the climb, the player faces complex
                    platform stages full of traps and challenging obstacles, where every move needs
                    be calculated accurately. Madeline acquires new abilities, such as Dash in the air, which helps her
                    reach difficult locations and overcome increasingly complex challenges. Death in Celeste is frequent
                    is expected, but the game encourages perseverance, with quick restarts and an emphasis on learning from

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Celeste's story takes place on the mystical and challenging mountain Celeste, where the protagonist,
                    Madeline decides to embark on a journey that goes far beyond a simple climb. When facing
                    physical and emotional obstacles, Madeline comes face to face with deep aspects of her own psyche,
                    confronting fears, insecurities and parts of herself that she tries to overcome. The mountain looks
                    respond to Madeline's internal conflicts by revealing itself as a place where mysterious forces
                    intensify their personal struggles, giving shape to an experience that is both an inner battle
                    as a physical challenge.

                <h2>Symbology</h2>
                <p>As Madeline makes her way up the treacherous slopes, she encounters symbolic characters such as Theo,
                    who share their struggles, and the Shadow, a manifestation of their insecurities and anxieties. THE
                    narrative is delivered in a subtle and poetic way, and the dialogues gradually reveal the layers of the
                    protagonist, offering fragments of a story that addresses themes such as anxiety, self-discovery
                    and acceptance. Just like in Hollow Knight, the game does not provide clear answers, encouraging the
                    player to interpret the meaning of the journey and the role of the mountain in Madeline's transformation.

                <h2>Mechanics</h2>
                <p>Celeste's mechanics are built around precise platforming, complex challenges, and a
                    accessible and rewarding learning curve, characteristics that define the "platform" style
                    difficult". Madeline, the protagonist, uses skills such as Dash in the air to overcome obstacles and
                    climb the mountain, allowing the player to explore each scenario in search of secret paths and
                    hidden items. With Dash, she can quickly move in eight directions, while the ability
                    clinging to walls temporarily enables unique strategies to advance across platforms
                    complex.</p>

                <h2>Strawberries</h2>
                <p>Throughout the game, new mechanics and challenges are creatively introduced, such as strong winds,
                    blocks that fall on contact and sections with altered gravity, each adding a layer of
                    difficulty and variety. The player can also collect strawberries as optional items, encouraging
                    careful exploration to unlock achievements and improve accuracy skill. The death
                    is often part of the experience, but with quick starts, Celeste encourages persistence,
                    offering engaging gameplay and a continuous learning system that motivates the player to
                    Refine your skills and advance towards the top.
