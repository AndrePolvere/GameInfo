                <h2>Mechanics</h2>
                <p>Minecraft's main mechanic is collecting and using blocks, which allows players to modify the
                    world around them and build virtually any structure they can imagine. In mode
                    Survival, players must explore the world in search of blocks and resources such as wood,
                    stone and ore, to build tools, shelters, and even complex redstone systems, which
                    simulate electrical circuits. Block mechanics make each world interactive and customizable,
                    allowing the player to shape their own universe and promote a unique gaming experience to
                    each match.</p>

                <h2>Crafting</h2>
                <p>The crafting system adds depth and purpose to exploration, encouraging players to
                    look for new materials, such as iron, diamond and even more exotic substances, such as blaze powder and
                    quartz, which are found in alternate dimensions. This mechanic also promotes creativity
                    and experimentation, as the player can mix different resources to create personalized items
                    or solve specific problems, such as building defenses against enemies or inventing tools
                    to facilitate mining. Crafting transforms the world of Minecraft into a space full of
                    possibilities.
