                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>Hollow Knight's story is told in a subtle way, without direct explanations, letting the
                    player discover the details as he progresses. The knight faces powerful creatures and bosses
                    while exploring the ruins of Hallownest, seeking to understand the origin of the corruption that plagues the

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The story of Hollow Knight takes place in the ancient and decaying underground kingdom of Hallownest, inhabited by
                    by insects and bizarre creatures. The protagonist, an unnamed knight, sets out on a journey to
                    discover the secrets of this world and understand what caused its downfall. The kingdom, once prosperous,
                    is now taken by a mysterious disease that has corrupted the inhabitants, transforming them into
                    monsters. The narrative is told in a subtle way, with most of the information being discovered
                    through exploration and interactions with enigmatic characters, who provide fragments of a
                    deep and engaging story.

                <h2>Hallownest</h2>
                <p>As the knight advances through the ruined land, he encounters several chieftains representing the
                    aspects of this corruption and discovers that his very existence is linked to the fall of Hallownest.
                    Elements of the knight's past, along with the kingdom's secrets, are revealed through
                    memories and hidden places. The game does not offer direct explanations, allowing the player to
                    build your own interpretation of the story, which makes the narrative even more mysterious and
                    intriguing. The knight's journey is a search for the truth as he faces ever-changing challenges.
                    more difficult to restore or destroy what remains of the kingdom.</p>

                <h2>Mechanics</h2>
                <p>Hollow Knight's mechanics are a mix of meticulous exploration, challenging combat and progression
                    of skills, characteristics that define the Metroidvania genre. The knight uses his sword, the
                    Sting, to face enemies and bosses, but the game also offers a variety of tools
                    additional. The Dream Sting, for example, allows the knight to interact with certain elements
                    of the world, how to cross spiritual barriers and reveal hidden secrets. Furthermore, the system
                    Amulets offer the player the possibility of equipping different enchantments that alter the
                    knight skills, allowing you to customize your gameplay.</p>

                <h2>Soul</h2>
                <p>Furthermore, the health and focus system, based on the Soul, is essential to the game's progression. THE
                    Knight can collect Soul by defeating enemies, which can be used to heal himself or cast
                    special attacks. Death is not definitive, but upon death, the player loses part of their Soul and must
                    return to the place of your death to recover lost progress. This mechanic brings a layer of
                    risk and reward, challenging players to learn from their mistakes as they explore the world. THE
                    combination of precise combat, deep exploration and an engaging progression system is one of the
                    Hollow Knight's biggest attractions.</p>
